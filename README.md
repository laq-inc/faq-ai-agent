# FAQ AI Agent

A production-oriented AI application project for learning modern backend architecture and AI development.

This project is not only about building a RAG application, but also about learning:

* DDD (Domain-Driven Design)
* Clean Architecture
* Modular Monolith
* Event-Driven Architecture
* Microservices
* AI Agents
* Claude Code Review
* GitHub Actions CI/CD
* Kubernetes

The goal is to build a practical system that can be used as a portfolio and serve as preparation for real-world AI development projects.

# Overview

FAQ AI Agent is an AI-powered FAQ platform that enables users to search company knowledge using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

The project evolves step by step from a simple RAG application into a production-ready platform with:

* AI Agent capabilities
* Automated code reviews
* CI/CD pipelines
* Kubernetes deployment
* Microservice architecture

---

# Goal

Build a practical AI application using the following technologies:

* Python
* FastAPI
* PostgreSQL
* pgvector
* OpenAI API
* RAG
* AI Agents
* Docker
* DDD
* Clean Architecture
* Modular Monolith
* Event-Driven Architecture
* Microservices
* Claude Code
* GitHub Actions
* Kubernetes

# Development Principles

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The project follows DDD principles:

* Entity
* Value Object
* Repository
* Domain Service
* Aggregate

---

## Clean Architecture

Dependency direction:

```txt
Adapter
      ↓
UseCase
      ↓
Repository Interface
      ↑
Infrastructure
      ↓
PostgreSQL
      ↓
pgvector
```

Business rules do not depend on frameworks or databases.

---

## Modular Monolith

The application will first be structured as a modular monolith.

```txt
modules/
├── faq
├── document
├── embedding
├── chat
└── auth
```

Each module communicates through well-defined interfaces.

---

## Microservices

After the modular monolith stage, modules will be extracted into independent services.

```txt
API Gateway
      │
 ┌────┼────┐
 │    │    │
FAQ Chat Auth
 │
Kafka
 │
Embedding
```

---

# Future Enhancements

* Multi-document RAG
* Hybrid Search
* Agent Memory
* Tool Calling
* Multi-Agent Architecture
* Observability
* Auto Scaling
* GitOps Deployment
* ArgoCD Integration

---

# Final Deliverables

* FAQ RAG Chat System
* FAQ Management AI Agent
* DDD Sample Application
* Clean Architecture Sample
* Modular Monolith Sample
* Microservices Sample
* Claude Code Review Environment
